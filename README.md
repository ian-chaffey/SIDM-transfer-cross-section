# SIDM-transfer-cross-section
Mathematica notebook which calcualtes the transfer cross section for self-interacting dark matter by solving the Schrodinger equation for a partial wave expansion of the wave function. The solution for the wave function is used to calculate the transfer cross section by itteratively adding angular momentum modes until the cross section converges to a 1% difference after each itteration. This algorithm is based on the algorithm described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.3898 and was used to calculate the transfer cross sections shown in https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10217. More details regarding the algorithm and its motivation are given in Appendix B of https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10217.
